# 🍏 Lifyzer Data Parser 🍓

_Simple script that parses data from open source food databases to the standard Lifyzer food DB structure._


## The Requirements ⚙

* 🐘 [PHP 7.1](http://php.net/releases/7_1_0.php) or higher
* 🎷 [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)


### ⚠️ Can be slow... with large databases 💾

When running `transform-csv-to-valid-file.php` with >= 2.4 GB CSV file for the food database provider, it can take nearly 5 days. Just keep your Web browser running and wait :)
