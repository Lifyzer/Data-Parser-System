# 🍏 Lifyzer Data Parser 🍓

_Simple script that parses data from open source food databases to the standard Lifyzer food DB structure._


## The Requirements ⚙

* 🐘 [PHP 7.1](http://php.net/releases/7_1_0.php) or higher
* 🎷 [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)


### ⚠️ Can be slow... with large databases 💾

When running `transform-csv-to-valid-file.php` with >= 2.4 GB CSV file for the food database provider, it can take nearly 5 days. Just keep your Web browser running and wait :)

## Tests 👷

Development tests require PHP 7.3+ for PHPUnit 9.6. CI exercises PHP 8.3 and 8.5;
the library retains its legacy PHP 7.1 source requirement, but that runtime is not
validated by the current test matrix. The unused Phake dependency is removed.

To run the test suites:

```console
$ composer install
$ php vendor/bin/phpunit

```
