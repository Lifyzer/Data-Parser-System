# 🍏 Lifyzer Data Parser 🍓

_Simple script that parses data from open source food databases to the standard Lifyzer food DB structure._


## The Requirements

* 🐘 [PHP 7.1](http://php.net/releases/7_1_0.php) or higher
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)


## This can be slow... With big databases

When running `transform-csv-to-valid-file.php` with >= 1.5 GB CSV file for the food database provider, it can take nearly 3 days. Just keep your Web browser running and wait :) 


## Who Did This...? 😉
